# aria-telegram-mirror-bot

This is a Telegram bot that uses [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to download files over BitTorrent / HTTP(S) and uploads them to your Google Drive. This can be useful for downloading from slow servers. Parallel downloading and download queuing are supported. There are some features to try to reduce piracy.

## Limitations

This bot is meant to be used in small, closed groups. So, once deployed, it only works in whitelisted groups.

## Warning

There is very little preventing users from using this to mirror pirated content. Hence, make sure that only trusted groups are whitelisted in `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`.

## Bot commands

* `/mirror <url>`: Download from the given URL and upload it to Google Drive. <url> can be HTTP(S), a BitTorrent magnet, or a HTTP(S) url to a BitTorrent .torrent file. A status message will be shown and updated while downloading.
* `/mirrorTar <url>`: Same as `/mirror`, but archive multiple files into a tar before uploading it.
* `/mirrorStatus`: Send a status message about all active and queued downloads.
* `/cancelMirror`: Cancel a particular mirroring task. To use this, send it as a reply to the message that started the download that you want to cancel. Only the person who started the task, SUDO_USERS, and chat admins can use this command.
* `/cancelAll`: Cancel all mirroring tasks in all chats if a [SUDO_USERS](#Constants-description) member uses it, or cancel all mirroring tasks for a particular chat if one of that chat's admins use it. No one else can use this command.
* `/list <filename>` : Send links to downloads with the `filename` substring in the name. In case of too many downloads, only show the most recent few. 

## Migrating from v1.0.0

Aria-telegram-mirror-bot is now written in TypeScript. If you are migrating from v1.0.0, move your existing `.constants.js` to `src/.constants.js`, and re-read the [installation section](#Installation) and the [section on updating](#Updating), as some steps have changed.

## Pre-installation

1. [Create a new bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) using Telegram's BotFather and copy your TOKEN.

2. Add the bot to your groups and optionally, give it the permission to delete messages. This permission is used to clean up status request messages from users. Not granting it will quickly fill the chat with useless messages from users.

3. Install [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2).
   * For Ubuntu:
     `sudo apt install aria2`

4. Get Drive folder ID:

   * Visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
   * Create a new folder. The bot will upload files inside this folder.
   * Open the folder.
   * The URL will be something like `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/012a_345bcdefghijk`. Copy the part after `folders/` (`012a_345bcdefghijk`). This is the `GDRIVE_PARENT_DIR_ID` that you'll need in step 5 of the Installation section.

## Installation

1. Install TypeScript with `sudo npm install -g typescript`

2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot
   cd aria-telegram-mirror-bot
   ```

3. Run `npm install`

4. Copy the example files:

   ```bash
   cp src/.constants.js.example src/.constants.js
   cp aria.sh.example aria.sh
   ```

5. Configure the aria2 startup script:

   * `nano aria.sh`
   * `ARIA_RPC_SECRET` is the secret (password) used to connect to aria2. Set this to whatever you want, and save the file with `ctrl + x`.
   * `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` is the number of download jobs that can be active at the same time. Note that this does not affect the number of concurrent uploads. There is currently no limit for the number of concurrent uploads.

6. Configure the bot:

   * `nano src/.constants.js`
   * Now replace the placeholder values in this file with your values. Use the [Constants description](#Constants-description) section below for reference.

7. Compile the project by running `tsc`

8. Set up OAuth:

   * Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
   * Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
   * Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
   * Choose Other and Create.
   * Use the download button to download your credentials.
   * Move that file to the root of aria-telegram-mirror-bot, and rename it to `client_secret.json`

9. Enable the Drive API:

   * Visit the [Google API Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) page.
   * Search for Drive.
   * Make sure that it's enabled. Enable it if not.

10. Start aria2 with `./aria.sh`

11. Start the bot with `npm start`

12. Open Telegram, and send `/mirror https://raw.githubusercontent.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/master/README.md` to the bot.

11. In the terminal, it'll ask you to visit an authentication URL. Visit it, grant access, copy the code on that page, and paste it in the terminal.

That's it.

## Constants description

This is a description of the fields in src/.constants.js:

* `TOKEN`: This is the Telegram bot token that you will get from Botfather in step 1 of Pre-installation.
* `ARIA_SECRET`: This is the password used to connect to the aria2 RPC. You will get this from step 4 of Installation.
* `ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION`: This is the directory that aria2 will download files into, before uploading them. Make sure that there is no trailing "/" in this path. The suggested path is `/path/to/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/downloads`
* `ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION_ROOT`: This is the mountpoint that contains ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION. This is used internally to calculate the space available before downloading.
* `ARIA_FILTERED_DOMAINS`: The bot will refuse to download files from these domains. Can be an empty list.
* `ARIA_FILTERED_FILENAMES`: The bot will refuse to completely download (or if already downloaded, then upload) files with any of these substrings in the file/top level directory name. Can be an empty list or left undefined.
* `GDRIVE_PARENT_DIR_ID`: This is the ID of the Google Drive folder that files will be uploaded into. You will get this from step 4 of Pre-installation.
* `SUDO_USERS`: This is a list of Telegram user IDs. These users can use the bot in any chat. Can be an empty list, if AUTHORIZED_CHATS is not empty.
* `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`: This is a list of Telegram Chat IDs. Anyone in these chats can use the bot in that particular chat. Anyone not in one of these chats and not in SUDO_USERS cannot use the bot. Someone in one of the chats in this list can use the bot only in that chat, not elsewhere. Can be an empty list, if SUDO_USERS is not empty.
* `STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS`: Set the time in milliseconds between status updates. A smaller number will update status messages faster, but Telegram will rate limit the bot if it sends/edits more than around 20 messages/minute/chat. As that quota includes messages other than status updates, do not decrease this number if you get rate limit messages in the logs.
* `DOWNLOAD_NOTIFY_TARGET`: The fields here are used to notify an external web server once a download is complete. See the [section on notifications below](#Notifying-an-external-webserver-on-download-completion) for details.
   * `enabled`: Set this to `true` to enable this feature.
   * `host`: The address of the web server to notify.
   * `port`: The server port ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
   * `path`: The server path ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Starting after installation

After the initial installation, use these instructions to (re)start the bot.

### Using tmux

1. Start aria2 by running `./aria.sh`
2. Start a new tmux session with `tmux new -s tgbot`, or connect to an existing session with `tmux a -t tgbot`. Running the bot inside tmux will let you disconnect from the server without terminating the bot. You can also use nohup instead.
3. Start the bot with `npm start`

### Using systemd

1. Install the systemd unit file `sudo cp -v contrib/mirror-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/`
2. Open `/etc/systemd/system/mirror-bot.service` with an editor of your choice and modify the path and user as per your environment.
3. Reload the systemctl daemon so it can see your new systemd unit `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Start the service `sudo systemctl start mirror-bot`
5. If you want the bot to automatically start on boot, run `sudo systemctl enable mirror-bot`

## Notifying an external webserver on download completion

This bot can make an HTTP request to an external web server once a download is complete. This can be when a download fails to start, fails to download, is cancelled, or completes successfully. See the section [on constants](#Constants-description) for details on how to configure it.

Your web server should listen for a POST request containing the following JSON data:

```
{
    'successful': boolean,
    'file': {
        'name': string,
        'driveURL': string,
        'size': string
    },
    originGroup: number
}
```

* `successful`: `true` if the download completed successfully, `false` otherwise
* `file`: Details about the file.
   * `name`: The name of the file. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
   * `driveURL`: The Google Drive download link to the downloaded file. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
   * `size`: A human-readable file size. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
* `originGroup`:  The Telegram chat ID for the chat the download was started in

If `successful` is false, any or all of the fields of `file` might be absent. However, if present, they are correct/reliable.

## Updating

Run `git pull`, then run `tsc`. After compilation has finished, you can start the bot as described in [the above section](#Starting-after-installation).
